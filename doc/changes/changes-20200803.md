# script-languages-release 20200803, released 2020-08-13
 
## Summary
This release introduces the new standard-flavor for Exasol 7.0+. Additionally, it adds new packages to the standard-flavors, such as boto3, pysftp and paramiko and fixes several bugs for the UDFs, the script-language containers and exaslct. 

However, most importantly, it greatly simplifies the customization of the script-language containers. Each flavor now provides package lists under the directory `flavors/<flavor-name>/flavor_customization/packages`. Additional packages entered into these lists get automatically installed when building the flavor. Furthermore, we provide detailed instructions on how to do other kinds of modifications to the container by changing the Dockerfile at `flavors/<flavor-name>/flavor_customization/Dockerfile`. Please find more information about this, in our [Readme](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release#how-to-customize-an-existing-flavor).
