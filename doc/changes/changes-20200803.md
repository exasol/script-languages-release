# script-languages-releae 20200803, released 2020-08-13
 
## Summary
This release introduces the new standard-flavor for Exasol 7.0+. Additionally, it adds a few new packages to the standard-flavors, such as boto3, pysftp and paramiko. It fixes several bugs for the UDFs, the script-language containers and exaslct. 

However, most importantly, it greatly simplifies the customization of the script-languages containers. Each flavor now provides in the flavor_customization directory package list files. Addtional packages entered into these lists get automatically installed when building the flavor. Furthormore, we provide detailed instrunctions how to do other kinds of changes via changing the Dockerfile within the flavor_customization directory. Please find more information about this, in our [Readme](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release#how-to-customize-an-existing-flavor).
